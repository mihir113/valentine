# Environment & Deployment Notes

## GitHub Repository
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mihir113/valentine1
- **Branch**: main
- **Purpose**: Version control and CI/CD integration with Vercel

## Vercel Deployment
- **Connected**: Yes, auto-deploys on push to main
- **URL**: (Add after first deployment)
- **Environment Variables**: All .env.local variables must be added to Vercel project settings
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (important: keep secret)
  - ADMIN_PASSWORD
  - NEXTAUTH_SECRET

## Important Notes
- The app uses Supabase for database and storage
- Admin operations require the service role key for proper Row Level Security (RLS) handling
- All sensitive keys should be added to Vercel's environment variables, NOT committed to git
- The .env.local file is in .gitignore and should never be committed
